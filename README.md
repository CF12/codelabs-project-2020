### codelabs-project-2020


"A live web chat platform built on top of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript -- powered by Node.js and Socket.io. We played around with more advanced features like authentication, encryption, and webRTC as the weeks progress. A cool project to show how you can turn a semi-simple web application into a much more complex & intricate platform by building and abstracting on top of everything."
