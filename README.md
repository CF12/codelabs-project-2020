# Roomify 
### codelabs-project-2020

"A live web chat platform built on top of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript -- powered by Node.js and Socket.io. We played around with more advanced features like authentication, encryption, and webRTC as the weeks progress. A cool project to show how you can turn a semi-simple web application into a much more complex & intricate platform by building and abstracting on top of everything."
 
## Description
* Roomify is a website that enables the user to interact with other users through chatting. 
* In order to use the platform, the user must register an account or login into their personal account. When the user makes an account, their user information is stored in a database. The user can also logout their account if they would like to do so. 
* The user can utilize the chatrooms by joining existing chatrooms or creating their own one. If the user creates the chatroom, they can manage the chatroom by changing the name and description. They can also delete the chatroom. 

## Challenge Encountered
* One of our fellow members left the team. Due to this obstacle, we pivoted and focused on collaborating with the remaining members.
